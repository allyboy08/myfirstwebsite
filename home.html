        <font color= "yellow">
        <p>What I like most about baseball is that everyone gets a chance to play when they bat and field, as you play there will be more intensity because you don't know what will happen nexgt</p>
        <p>One thing about baseball that i like is the history of Jackie Robbertson who was the first African to play major league basaball and his club retired the the number 42 in honor of him</p>
